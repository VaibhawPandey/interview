 Read Trilok Answer here :

Step 1 : Have the ratings[] array to store 0 to N-1 students ratings.
Step 2 : Have the candies_given[] array to store 0 to N-1 students candies.
Step 3 : Assign candies_given[] array as 1 for all i=0 to N-1. (Minimum candies given should be 1 )
Step 4 : Traverse through ratings array. For every rating check whether current rating is larger than the rating before. if current rating is more, then set candies_given[i] as (candies_given[i-1]+1).
Step 5 : Traverse through ratings array in reverse. For every rating check whether current rating is larger than the rating after. if current rating is more, then check whether candies_given[i] is more than candies_given[i+1], that means it fulfills the condition already due to first traversal(therefore, skip it and move on), but if not, then set candies_given[i] as (candies_given[i+1]+1).
Step 6 : Add all the elements of the candies_given array.

Simple pseudo-code :

--- Step 4 ---
if(rating[i]>rating[i-1])
       candies_given[i]=candies_given[i-1]+1;

--- Step 5 ---
if(rating[i]>rating[i+1])
    if(candies_given[i]<=candies_given[i+1])
          candies_given[i]=candies_given[i+1]+1;
