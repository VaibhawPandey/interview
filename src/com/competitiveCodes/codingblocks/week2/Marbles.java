    /*
    Using Beggars Method Of Combination :
    For sequence : X1 + X2 + X3 +...Xk = N (where x1, x2, x3 >= 0)
    Example: Beggars Method is used when we have N coins and we need to distribute among K Beggars
    formula = (N + K - 1) C (K -1)
    Marbles: We have N marbles, we have to pick K marbles, should be of different color.
    So, we need to modify beggars formula a little:
    It's like we have assign : First marbles as  -> Then first marbles is already taken so
