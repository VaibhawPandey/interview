    /*
    There are many clever solutions in the discussion, but they aren't exactly straightfoward to me,
    so I've worked out myself.

    First, there are two exception cases, like below:

    Step 1: k == 0: print all the numbers from 1 to N

    Step 2 : if (n / k) % 2 is not ZERO, print -1 (as this must be zero to be absolute factorial)

    Otherwise, follow the pattern below:

    Step 3 :

    if we go from 1 to N (i),

    Permutation is either i+k or i-k. It always starts with i+k.

    step 3.1 : Put i+k to permutaion for k times

    step 3.2 : Switch to i-k for k times

    repeat 1 & 2 until the end.

        Another way to look at it is if n % (2*k) is not ZERO, print -1.
        That's because you'll need to "shuffle" groups of 2*k elements.

        For example, when n = 8 and k = 2, you'll start off with [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] and shuffle groups of 4 like this:

        1 and 3

        2 and 4

        -

        5 and 7

        6 and 8

        ...

        The approach works in this case because 8 is divisible by 4.
        Or more generally, it will work when n is divisible by 2*k.
